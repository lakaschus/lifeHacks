# Find reusable package.json files for your project

To get started in modern frontend development can be a lot pain because getting all your packages and dependencies right is very cumbersome and most importantly, it is not fun.
A possible solution is to search for already public available package.json files that contain all the packages you need for your project.
To this end, I found the following Google search to be efficient for looking for package.json files that contain the packages "package A" ... "package Z"

`site:github.com "package.json" "package A" "package B" ... "package Z"`

### Example

If you like to start a new project with *vue 2.6.12*, *tailwindcss*, *firebase* and *axios* employ the following search:

`site:github.com "package.json" "vue" "2.6.12" "tailwindcss" "firebase" "axios"`

Of course, the less specific the more results. So it might be useful to omit the version number to get more results.
