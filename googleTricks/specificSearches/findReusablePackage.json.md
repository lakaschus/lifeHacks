# Find reusable package.json files for your project

To get started in modern frontend development can be a lot pain because getting all your packages and dependencies right is very cumbersome and most importantly, it is not fun.
A possible solution is to search for already public available package.json files that contain all the packages you need for your project.
To this end, I found the following Google search to be efficient for looking for package.json files that contain the packages "package A" ... "package Z"

`site:github.com "package.json" "package A" "package B" ... "package Z"`
